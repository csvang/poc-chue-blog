# Proof of Concept - Chue Blog

The proof of concept is to understand Gatsby and its features.  

## Get Started

1.  Install Dependencies
    ```shell
    npm i
    ```

2.  Run Site
    ```shell
    cd poc-chue-blog/
    npm run develop
    ```
    
3.  Open and Review The Source Code

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `poc-chue-blog` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
